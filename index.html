                    <p class="text-dark">For Emma Poland, dance is not just a passion, but a way of life. With 20 years of
                        experience in dance and nearly 10 years experience teaching dance, Emma has always
                        believed in the transformative power of movement. From their first dance class to the many
                        stages they’ve graced, dance has taught them lessons in perseverance, self-expression, and
                        the beauty of vulnerability.</p>
    
                    <p class="text-dark">As an instructor, Emma strives to create a space where every student feels seen, valued, and
                        inspired. Whether it’s a beginner learning their first steps or an advanced dancer refining their
                        technique, Emma works to nurture each individual’s unique journey, reminding them that every
                        misstep is part of the process, and every moment of growth is worth celebrating.

                    <p class="text-dark">
                        What drives Emma most is the joy that comes from watching students build confidence, not just
                        in their dance, but in themselves. Dance, to Emma, is about more than mastering a routine—it’s
                        about finding your voice, connecting with others, and discovering the strength you didn’t know
                        you had.

                    <p class="text-dark">
                        Outside the studio,Emma continues to explore the world of dance, learning from every
                        opportunity and every person they meet. With a heart full of gratitude, they are excited to share
                        their love for movement, inspire creativity, and help students grow both as dancers and as
                        individuals.

                        I believe in fostering a love for dance while emphasizing technical precision and creativity. My
                        approach involves a non judgmental supportive space, creating and growing confidence, and
                        personal accountability. I aim to inspire my students to challenge themselves and explore their
                        own artistic expression.
